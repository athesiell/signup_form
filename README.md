# Signup form

It's a project where I've built simple sign up page using the knowledge I gained from previous lessons on HTML forms and CSS styling on [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form)

# Features
1. Custom font
2. HTML forms
3. Using 'absolute' and 'relative' positioning in CSS
